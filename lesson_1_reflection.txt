How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Diff shows lines in both files which were changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can go back to older versions of my file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I can commit after a logical change. I can forget to do it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    They are not designed for programming.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log shows previous commits, git diff shows differences between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can always return to the previous version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to compare different versions of code.
